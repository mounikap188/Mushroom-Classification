# Mushroom-Classification
This project and code deals with the mushrooms.csv dataset sourced from the Kaggle Dataset Library. The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification
# Goal
The main goal of this project is to create a classification model to identify the class labels for the output variable: "class", which aims at differentiation of the mushrooms to edible and poisonous classes.
# Data dictionary
