# Mushroom-Classification
# This project and code deals with the mushrooms.csv dataset sourced from the Kaggle Dataset Library. The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification
# The main goal of this project is to create a classification model to identify the class labels for the output variable: "class", which aims at differentiation of the mushrooms to edible and poisonous classes.
# Data dictionary of the file is located in the UCI Machine Learning Repository here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom
# Any questions about the code can be directed to me at mpalakur@csu.edu
